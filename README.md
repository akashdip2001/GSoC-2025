---
7. **BEAD: Background Enrichment augmented Anomaly Detection (BEAD) for new physics searches at LHC**  
   - **Why?** You have experience in **data analysis (Taguchi method, Minitab software)**. This project focuses on **anomaly detection in physics data**, which is closely related to your **IoT data analysis projects**.  
---
### **Alternative Choices (If you want to focus more on security & IoT)**  
- **Xeus-Cpp: Implementing Debugging Support** (Good for C++ debugging in scientific computing)  
- **ROOT: RNTuple in JSROOT** (If you want to work on structured data for physics applications)  
- **ML4EP: TMVA SOFIE - GPU Support for Machine Learning Inference** (If you're interested in **AI acceleration & DevOps**)  
---
### **Best Strategy**  
- **Step 1:** Pick a project that aligns with your DevOps/DevSecOps, cloud, or IoT expertise.  
- **Step 2:** Start **learning and contributing** to the project's GitHub repo (if available).  
- **Step 3:** Contact the project maintainers or mentors early to express interest.  
- **Step 4:** Build a small demo project related to the topic to showcase your skills in the proposal.  

### **Final Recommendation**  
Your best pick is **CernVM-FS (Cloud & DevOps)** or **SMARTHEP (FinOps & ML cost estimation)**, followed by **Ganga (AI in scientific computing)** or **BEAD (Physics & data analysis)**.
